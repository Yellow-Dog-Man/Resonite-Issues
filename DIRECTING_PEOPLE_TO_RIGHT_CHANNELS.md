# Direct people to the right channels
We have a number of dedicated channels for answering people’s questions and concerns and providing feedback. Everyone on the team and in the community is strongly encouraged to direct people to those channels, rather than engaging in random places.

This ensures that we stay open and transparent, while also ensuring we answer people’s questions in the most effective way in a dedicated place and time. There’s a number of benefits to this:

- It gives dedicated places more traffic, bringing more people to them and increasing visibility
- It increases the visibility of answers - an answer in a random post on Discord gets lost more easily and only seen by smaller amount of people
- It gives people time to better formulate their questions/concerns
- We don’t have to be constantly available to answer questions, adding a lot of stress - we have dedicated time to it

Remember to also direct positive questions and feedback to those channels as well, not just negative ones! We want a variety of questions and feedback.

## Where to direct people

### Office hours - questions & answers
Office hours are regular streams by different teams and team members to answer questions live. Currently we have regular office hours:

- ProbablePrime (engineering) - Tuesday
    - Recordings published on Discord
    - Great for engineering, infrastructure and some business questions!
- Art team - Wednesday
    - Recordings published on YouTube
    - Great for questions about in-game content
    - Cloud home, tools, inventory organization and more!
    - Great for questions about building things in-game too with live showcases
- Moderation - Sunday
    - Recordings published on YouTube
    - Great for questions about moderation, mentors, guidelines
    - Bring suggestions and concerns (that are publicly share-able) to these streams as well
- Resonance (Froox, engineering & general) - Sunday
    - Recordings & clips published on YouTube
    - Great for engineering and general Resonite questions
    - Ask about Resonite's philosophy, goals, future and past!
- Recap streams (Q&A section) - Monthly
    - Recordings published on YouTube
    - Good for quick broad Q & A
    - Good source to learn some major changes and updates for the past month

People can ask questions both live during the stream or ask them in Discord forums in advance and then watch the recordings afterwards if they can’t attend live.

### GitHub - bugs, features, feedback
Any bugs, feature requests, tweaks and feedback needs to go to GitHub to be potentially actioned. It’s important to stress to people that unless there’s a GitHub issue, we won't be able to work on a given issue or fix a given bug.

Encourage people to follow the GitHub guidelines - including all the necessary information increases the likelihood of us addressing their issue. Not following the guidelines makes our work harder and the issue is less likely to get picked up.

If users are having trouble making GitHub issue, suggest asking a Mentor to make one for them instead.

### Moderation tickets - problems with users & harassment
Any issues with users harassing others, breaking guidelines and causing other problems on the platform should be handled through a moderation ticket.

### Contact form - business inquiries
For any business questions and other inquiries, direct people to the contact form at yellowdogman.com or directly at business@resonite.com 

These inquiries are directly handled by our business team.

### Support tickets - non-software issues
For any issues that are not bugs or feature requests, direct users to make a support ticket. This can handle issues like:

- Patreon/Stripe problems (e.g. not getting benefits)
- Problems with user’s account

### Mentors - in-game help
For any help with in-game things - setting up avatars, learning the tools, ProtoFlux and so on, mentors can be a great resource to provide help and teaching. Encourage people to seek out mentors. There’s a number of ways to do so:

- Finding user with the mentor badge in-game
- Joining a help world (e.g. “Avatar Help World”)
- Messaging in the [user help section of Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1040316820650991766/1243347566892941435)
