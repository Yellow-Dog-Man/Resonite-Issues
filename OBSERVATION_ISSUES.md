# Feedback & observations issue templates
One of the things that helps us a lot isn’t just specific features or bugs, but also general feedback and observations from the community. 

Understanding how people interact with the platform, what they like and what causes frustrations helps us drive the direction and design features to help with the pain points, while also encouraging us to do more things that people find enjoyable. 

However we don’t have a good issue template for this kind of feedback. To fix this, we’re introducing two new issue templates:

## Positive observation
All issue types we have focus on things that are “wrong” - either broken or missing in some way. While it’s important to know about those, so we can fix and improve, it’s also important to know what we did right.

There’s a few big reasons for this:
- It helps balance the mood, improve our mental health and encourage us to work on more improvements
- It encourages us to put more time and effort into things that work and make positive impact on the community
    - This one I can’t stress more than enough - if we see that the effort we put into something has brought fruit, we’ll want to do more of that and create positive feedback loop
- It provides an avenue for people enjoying the platform that are normally silent to speak up
- If you provide us with some showcases of what you made with our new features, we'll show them off through our official channels and give you a shoutout!

There’s a number of reasons why you could make this kind of issue:
- A recent bugfix or feature addition made your life easier
- An established feature makes you happy or helps you and you’d like to encourage us to give it more love
- You want us to keep working and expanding existing features rather than moving to something else
- For example, if you really like working with PhotonDust (our particle system) and you’d like us to add more modules and features to it, this can help encourage us to do this!

The goal of this issue template is to introduce a positive feedback loop to the development, rather than just negative. We work much better when we’re encouraged to make improvements, rather than beaten down with negativity.

### Getting a shoutout and promoting your work
If you include a video (or at least a screenshot) as part of your positive observation issue showcasing some cool things you've done with a new feature we added (or even a bugfix) - we'll show it off through our official channels and give you a shoutout!

It's a great way to promote both the new features we worked on (and show us some cool stuff you made) and get your work showcased more officially through our streams - some of the best showcases we'll show off at the monthly recap stream!

## Friction point observation
We understand that not everything is rainbows and sunshine though. And while we already have plenty of issue types for bugs and missing features, there’s one particular type that would help us a lot, but that doesn’t fit neatly into any of the existing templates.

As developers, we often look for solutions to resolve a number of friction points. Coming up with designs and features is a big part of our job, but many specific bug reports and feature requests don’t let us do that job.

To resolve this, we’re introducing another type of issue that’s meant to document friction points in an objective, observational manner - without the need to come up with solutions. The goal is to make us understand what you or another user gets stuck on or what causes difficulties when using Resonite.

These issues don’t need to be directly actionable themselves - we can collate a number of them to figure out a solution and approach.

Also importantly - these issues (and technically none of the GitHub issues) are NOT places to vent frustrations. The goal is to be objective and constructive and encourage improvements to the platform and understand what kind of issues are people running into, while leaving the emotions of it at the door - we want the feedback to be thoughtful, not draining.

It also provides a place to log this feedback and leave it there, rather than it being brought up repeatedly through lots of different channels and provides a method (upvoting the issue) to help us gauge how many people run into a particular type of problem.
