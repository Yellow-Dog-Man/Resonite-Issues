      description: If a recent change (e.g. fixed bug or implemented feature) has led to a positive experience, let us know which one it was! E.g. you can include Resonite version, link to changelog or it can be kept more vague (e.g. within last week). Or you can just say "No" or leave empty if the positive observation is for a feature that's been around for a while.
