The majority of the work we do is work that “must” be done. High priorities, bugfixes, community & business client demands. This type of work is very draining, especially over time, because it doesn’t leave much room for fun things, exploring ideas and generally being creative.

To balance this, from now on, team members are now entitled (and encouraged) to spend at least one day of the week focusing on more creative & experimentative issues. This means that they can prioritize something where the only criteria is their own personal choice - never any demands from the community, business or other team members.

The goal of this work also isn’t necessarily to ship a new feature or bugfix - it’s to experiment and be free to explore. If the work ends up turning into something that ends up merged and released, that’s fine and can come after, however for the day itself - it’s just to explore without any pressures.

If the team member decides to turn the experimentation work into something that gets merged - this puts additional constraints on the work that can add more stress and worries - ensuring compatibility, code cleanliness and such. But doing those too early can kill good ideas and the fun of creativity.

If team members share that they’re working on something as their “creative day” thing - please respect that. Questions like “Why is this being prioritized?”, making specific demands on the feature or pushing against it can very quickly kill the motivation and the fun - and the point of creative days is to encourage it instead.

Please be positive and encouraging with those features - there’s a good chance the team member is working on it to relax and rebuild motivation, so keeping things in spirit of playful experimentation is important.

Once the work transforms into actual integration, you can bring more concerns and specific things that might “bring it down” and kill the fun - but please, not before then.

If team members also need to sacrifice their creative day for a deadline or urgent matter - they should take it later instead (e.g. do two the next week).

Another important thing - we need to make sure to clearly mark issues & devlogs as “creative / experimentation” ones - this will let people know that it’s being prioritized by the developer for fun and adjust their expectations, while also normalizing the presence of such work!

## Label
(CreativeDayLabel.png)

Creative / Experimentation day issues will be marked with this label while they're in the creative / experimentation phase!

If they shift from this phase to normal "Let's ship this" - the label should be removed.

## Rules for developers
- Each dev is entitled to 1 creative day a week
    - This still leaves most of the week for the work that **needs** to be done for community, business, stability and so on
    - If for some reason the developer needs to work on urgent things and lose their creative day, they should take two the next week
    - It can be any day of the week (or even spread throughout the week) - generally majority of the time during week should be on important things, but some should be dedicated to fun things
    - When experiencing burnout (especially from long projects and overtime) and need for recovery, it can be more than 1 day a week
- Please clearly mark issues as "Creative Day" for the community
    - Use the "Creative Day" GitHub label
    - Mention the issue is "Creative Day" in Devlogs, videos and so on
    - This is both to ensure community knows why it's prioritized and to normalize this concept!
- Don't worry about mergeability of the work when experimenting
    - The goal is to explore and have fun, not ship new features
    - The experimentation can break our core principles - it wouldn't likely get merged if transitioned into "let's ship this", but it's okay to do so when experimenting
    - That said, the work turning into a new feature is okay too, but we want to be explicit about when it transitions from "fun & play" to "let's ship this"
    - Have fun with it and get some cool ideas!
- Use a good judgement when transitioning from "creative" to "let's ship this"
    - If there's reason for concerns in the community, let community know the feature has transitioned and gather thoughts/feedback
    - If the addition is innocuous (e.g. a new procedural mesh) you can skip this
    - Consider how much extra work is needed to actually ship the feature - if very little, you can just do this, but if it's a lot more, discuss the prioritization of that work with the team first please

## Rules for community
- The prioritization of these issues is **solely** choice of the developer
    - If the issue is marked as Creative Day, please respect this
    - Do not ask questions like "Why is this being prioritized?" or argue against the developer working on them instead of other things
- Keep in mind that "Creative Day" issues won't necessarily get merged and released
    - If they were to merged, they will undergo same processes and evaluation as any other change
    - Some experiments might not work out or be acceptable (e.g. due to breaking core principles, compatibility, security and so on) - but it's okay for developers to experiment with them
- When providing feedback, be encouraging
    - Do not shut the work and experimentation down - the goal for the dev is to have fun and doing so can do damage to their mental health and impact their overall work
    - Be positive and encouraging with your suggestions and ideas - work with the dev, not against them
    - Be gentle - keep in mind it's **their** fun day and the goal is experimentation and new ideas, not shipping a new feature
